Project 1 Matching 
I am creating a numbers matching game. 

Once the user clicks the new game button all the cards will get assigned a number. All the cards will be blank until one is clicked on. Once a card is clicked a number will be displayed.
The user will click each card one by one trying to match pairs

The layout of the game goes as follows
top of the screen will have game name and a Match counter which will increase for each match that is made 
Body of screen will have all the cards
Left column will have a new game and quit button.
