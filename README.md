Project 1 Matching 
I am creating a fun numbers matching game. 

Once the user clicks the new game button all the cards will show their values for about one second. Then the cards will be flipped or blank and the user will begin guessing.
The user will be clicking each card one by one trying to match pairs. Once a pair is matched the card numbers will stay visible. 

The layout of the game goes as follows
top of the screen will have game name and welcoming message
Body of screen will have all the cards
Left column will have a new game and quit button. 
I want to add a difficulty feature in the left column where you can choose beginner, intermediate, expert feature that will increase the number of cards
The right column will have a 3 minute timer that will count down. And will keep track of all the final times of the previous games played and at which difficulty. 
If the timer runs out before the user has matched all the cards, the right column will display game over which will flip all the cards and quit out of the current game.
